    "## Why \"Apple\" Queries Can Fail in Vector-Cypher Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question like \"What are the risks that Apple faces?\" using a vector-Cypher retriever, you may not get the structured or complete answer you expect. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How Vector-Cypher Works:**  \n",
    "  - The retrieval process first performs a semantic search over all text chunks in the graph.\n",
    "  - It retrieves the top-k chunks most similar to your query—regardless of which company (or entity) they are about.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query then starts from each chunk and traverses the graph for related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Problem with Entity-Centric Queries:**  \n",
    "  - If your query is about \"Apple,\" but there are no chunks whose text is semantically similar to your query and also specifically about Apple, the retriever may return:\n",
    "    - Chunks about other companies.\n",
    "    - Chunks that mention \"risk\" but not \"Apple.\"\n",
    "    - Generic or boilerplate risk factor text.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query can only traverse from the retrieved chunk—it cannot \"filter\" or \"redirect\" to Apple if the chunk isn’t already about Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Limitation:**  \n",
    "  - **The chunk is the anchor.** If your query is about an entity (like Apple), but the chunk retrieval is not entity-aware, you may never reach the correct node or context in the graph.\n",
    "  - This is especially problematic for broad or entity-centric questions, where you want to aggregate or summarize information about a specific node (e.g., a company) rather than just retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "> Vector-Cypher retrieval is powerful for finding relevant context, but it is fundamentally limited by the chunk-centric approach. For entity-centric questions, you need either:\n",
    "> - Chunks that are explicitly about the entity, or\n",
    "> - A retrieval/query strategy that starts from the entity node itself, not from arbitrary text chunks."

    "## VectorCypherRetriever Example: Detailed Search with Context — Why This Is a Good Query\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use `VectorCypherRetriever` to answer nuanced, relationship-driven questions by combining semantic search with graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is a good query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Relevance:**  \n",
    "  The vector retriever surfaces text chunks that are semantically similar to the question (\"Who are the asset managers most affected by banking regulations?\"). This grounds the search in passages that actually discuss asset managers and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Contextualization:**  \n",
    "  The Cypher query starts from each relevant chunk and traverses the graph to:\n",
    "    - Find the source document.\n",
    "    - Identify the company associated with the document.\n",
    "    - Traverse to asset managers that own or are related to that company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured and Contextual Output:**  \n",
    "  The result provides:\n",
    "    - The company name (`company`)\n",
    "    - The asset manager’s name (`manager`)\n",
    "    - The text context from the original chunk (`context`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why it works well:**  \n",
    "  - The question is naturally chunk-centric: you want to find meaningful passages about asset managers and regulations, then extract structured information about the entities involved.\n",
    "  - The graph traversal enriches the answer, linking unstructured context (text) to structured graph entities (companies, managers).\n",
    "  - This approach leverages the best of both worlds: semantic search for relevance, and graph queries for structure and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "This pattern is ideal when your question is about relationships or context that can be surfaced from relevant passages, and when you want to return both the context and the structured entities connected to it.  \n",
    "It is less effective for purely entity-centric aggregation (like \"all risks for Apple\"), but perfect for questions where the chunk is the natural anchor for graph exploration.\n"

The consolidated financial statements, which include\\namounts based on management's estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with\\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\n \\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable\\nassurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or\\ndisposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements\\nand maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an\\norganizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of\\nqualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.\\n \\nThe Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to\\naudit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over\\nfinancial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States).\\n \\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of\\nthe Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent\\nregistered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss\\nmatters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.

    "## VectorCypherRetriever Example: Finding Shared Risks Among Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to combine semantic search with graph traversal to uncover relationships—specifically, risks that connect major tech companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this query works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Search:**  \n",
    "  The vector retriever finds the top-k text chunks most relevant to your query (\"What risks connect major tech companies?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Traversal:**  \n",
    "  For each retrieved chunk (`node`):\n",
    "  - Follows the `:FROM_DOCUMENT` and `:FILED` relationships to a company (`c1`).\n",
    "  - Finds all risk factors (`risk`) that `c1` faces.\n",
    "  - Finds other companies (`c2`) that also face the same risk factor.\n",
    "  - Ensures that `c1` and `c2` are different companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns:**  \n",
    "  - `source_company`: The company from the retrieved chunk.\n",
    "  - `related_companies`: Companies sharing at least one risk with the source company.\n",
    "  - `shared_risks`: The names of the risk factors connecting these companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why this is powerful:**  \n",
    "  - Leverages the chunk as the semantic anchor, but then uses graph logic to discover structured, multi-entity relationships.\n",
    "  - Surfaces both the context (from the chunk) and the broader network of shared risks—something that pure semantic or pure graph search alone would struggle to do as effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Summary:**  \n",
    "> This approach is ideal for exploratory questions about relationships in your graph, where you want to start from relevant context but end up with structured, comparative insights.\n"

    "## Text2CypherRetriever Example ---\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to use the `Text2CypherRetriever` to automatically generate Cypher queries from natural language questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The retriever uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate your plain-English query into a Cypher query, based on your Neo4j schema.\n",
    "- The schema is provided as a string describing the main node types and relationships in your graph (e.g., companies, risk factors, asset managers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Workflow:**\n",
    "1. You provide a natural language question, such as:\n",
    "   > \"What are the company names of companies owned by BlackRock Inc.\"\n",
    "2. The retriever generates a corresponding Cypher query using the schema and the LLM.\n",
    "3. The generated Cypher is printed, allowing you to inspect or execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is powerful:**\n",
    "- Removes the need to manually write Cypher for each question.\n",
    "- Makes graph querying accessible to non-technical users.\n",
    "- Great for rapid prototyping, exploration, and building natural language interfaces to your knowledge graph.\n"
