    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### `conversation = []`\n",
    "- This is a Python list that stores the full history of the current session in-memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Send the Question to the Agent**\n",
    "    - Calls `chat_agent.invoke(...)` with the user’s question and the current session ID.\n",
    "    - The agent uses the full message history for context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capture the Answer**\n",
    "    - Extracts the agent’s answer from the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Append to Local Conversation**\n",
    "    - Adds a dictionary with the question and response to the `conversation` list.\n",
    "    - This allows you to review the session in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log to Neo4j**\n",
    "    - If `last_query_nodes` exists (i.e., the agent used the company tool and found relevant nodes), the function:\n",
    "        - Calls `log_query_nodes_to_neo4j` to:\n",
    "            - Store the session, message, and relationships (company, risk factors) in Neo4j.\n",
    "            - Chain messages in order via the `:NEXT` relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print and Return the Answer**\n",
    "    - Prints the agent’s answer for immediate feedback in the notebook.\n",
    "    - Returns the answer so it can be used in further processing if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this design useful?**\n",
    "- **Session persistence:** All questions and answers are logged in Neo4j, so the full conversation (and the order of messages) can be reconstructed at any time.\n",
